## Mini In-Memory Database

This project is a mini in-memory database implemented in C for learning purposes. It combines linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, and binary search trees into a single working system, all accessible through a simple command-line interface.

## 1. Features

* Insert, search, delete, and display records
* Fast record lookup using a hash table
* Filter records based on CGPA
* Sort records by age using a Binary Search Tree
* Maintain command history using a stack
* Store operation result messages using a queue

## 2. Project Structure

```
mini-db/
│
├── database.h    // Data structures and function declarations
├── database.c    // Core database logic and implementations
├── main.c        // Command-line interface
└── example.txt   // Sample input commands
```

---

## 3. Build Instructions

### Compile

```bash
gcc main.c database.c -o mini-db
```

### Run (interactive mode)

```bash
./mini-db
```

### Run (with sample input)

```bash
./mini-db < example.txt
```

## 4. How It Works

* All records are stored in a **linked list**, which acts as the primary data store.
* A **hash table** maps record IDs to enable fast search operations.
* A **stack** maintains the history of executed commands.
* A **queue** stores result and status messages generated by operations.
* A **binary search tree (BST)** is constructed dynamically to sort records by age.

The entire system operates in memory and is designed to demonstrate how multiple fundamental data structures can be combined to build a functional database-like application in C.
